`Disclaimer: This is still a work in progress`

A ruleset for tabletop roleplaying games that aims to be:
  * story first
  * simple
  * fast playing
  * classless
  * setting agnostic (currently geared towards fantasy, will eventualy have setting specific rules moved from the base system into optional modules)

While still maintaining:
  * the ability of the GM to tailor difficulty and play style for the group
  * just enough rules to inspire and guide players and dms
