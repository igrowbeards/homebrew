# Gameplay Rules

### Action Checks
  Characters will frequently take actions that may or may not succeed. During the
  course of play players and the GM will make checks to decide the results of
  actions.
  
  Checks are rolled on a single d20 + skill versus a target number provided by the GM.

  Target name | Target number 
  ------------|-------------
  easy        | 5
  normal      | 10
  hard        | 15
  heroic      | 20

  When instructed to roll a skill or attribute check, you roll a d20 and add 
  any relevant skill or attribute modifiers (positive or negative).
  If you're not sure if something should apply a modifier just ask the GM.
  Equal or greater than the target means your character was able to accomplish
  their stated goal.

  A natural one is a catastrophic failure and a natural 20 is a critical success, regardless of modifier.
  
#### Failing Action Checks   

  Under normal circumstances failing a talent or attribute check just means that what you're trying to do doesn't work
  and you suffer any logical ramifications of that.

  However in some circumstances failure on checks can lead to temporary damage to your attributes.

  * A critical failure on a check causes the difference after any modifiers between the target and the result 
    after any modifiers in damage to the relevant attribute. If the attribute that should be damaged isn't obvious 
    it's left to the GM's discrection.
  * Failure on a casting check _always_ causes temporary cognition damage.

### Attributes

#### Basic Attributes
  There are 4 basic attributes that define your character:

  * Strength
  * Agility
  * Cognition
  * Charisma

  All attributes start at 5, You get 15 points when characters are created to buff these scores.
  In addition at character creation you may lower one attribute to by up to 5 points (to 0) and use the points removed 
  on one of your other attributes if you so choose.
  Any attribute at 0 or bellow should be a major part of the character and role-played as such.
  
  In addition to being used as the basis for checks when a talent is not more appropriate your attributes modify the results 
  of other actions your player may take.

  * Strength modifies the damage dealt when you hit someone with something held in your hand or thrown.
  * Dexterity makes you more difficult to hit (adds to your armor class)
  * Cognition is added to spell casting attempts
  * Charisma is added to attempts to lie, persuade, or perform

  You gain modifiers to relevant checks based on the following scale:

  score      | modifier
  -----------|-----------
  20         | +3
  15...19    | +2
  10...14    | +1 
  5...9      | 0
  1...4      | -1 
  0...-4     | -2 
  -5...-9    | -3 
  <= -10     | disabled
   
   At -10 in any ability score your character is disabled.
   With regards to agility this means they are crippled, paralyzed or otherwise cannot move.
   When at -10 or lower in cognition your character is unconscious, stunned, or comatose.
   It would be uncommon to be at -10 in charisma and so the consequences thereof are left as an exercise for the GM.
   
   The major outlier in these is strength. If you character reaches -10 or lower in strength, their body is too weakened
   or damaged to go on. They are unconscious and will die if not tended to soon or if they take any further damage.
   
#### Derived Attributes

  Characters have 2 attributes derived from other factors
  These are armor class and Hit Points

  Armor Class represents how difficult to hit and/or well protected your character is.
  The armor class stat is equal to a base of 8 (for an alert character who is able to move)
  plus their dexterity modifier, plus their armor bonus.

  Hit Points represent your characters toughness, or their ability to be battered and bruised without lasting damage.
  When receiving damage, points will be taken from this stat until none are left.
  Any subsequent damage is subtracted from the characters strength.

  Your characters starting hit points are equal to 5 plus your characters strength modifier

---

### Talents

  You define your characters skills via a list of talents 
  Talents give your character bonuses to related checks.
  Unless your GM tell you otherwise your character starts with 3 talents.

  Talents are defined and recorded in the form of

  > "My character is _skill level_ at _talent_"

  The possible talent levels are:

  level name    | bonus
  --------------|--------
  good          | +1
  very good     | +2
  above average | +3
  great         | +4
  amazing       | +5
  legendary     | +7

  For example:

  > "Arthur is good at fighting with medium weapons"
  >
  >  "Leroy Jenkins is very good at maneuvering in heavy armor"
  >
  >  "Robin Hood is amazing at firing bows"
  >
  >  "Rocky is great at unarmed fighting"
  >
  >  "Dumbledore is legendary at evocation spells"
    
  All magical talents are special skills that can usually only be taken during character creation
  (unless your GM says otherwise).
  
  Magical talents should usually be fairly focused. Some good examples would be:

  * life or death magic
  * a specific element (fire, ice, air, etc) magic
  * illusion

### Weaknesses    
  
  Your characters weaknesses are things that your character has trouble doing, or situations that cause him to perform poorly.

  They are defined and recorded in the form of:

  > "My character is _level_ at _skill_"

  or

  > "My character is _level_ when confronted with _situation_"
  
  The possible talent levels are:
  
  level                          | modifier
  -------------------------------|----------
  bad / uneasy / dislikes        | -1
  awful / scared / hates         | -2 
  hopeless / terrified / loathes | -3 

  During character creation you _must_ take at least one weakness, but may optionally take 2 more levels.
  You may increase a skill by one level for each of the 2 optional weakness levels you take.

  Be aware that weaknesses are not just numbers on the page, but should be used when role-playing your character as well
  as by the GM when crafting adventures.

### Casting Spells

  Characters can cast spells relevant to their magical talents at will, and without having predefined "spells"
  To cast a spell tell the GM what you are trying to do (preferably with a flashy name and description)
  Your GM will then tell you the target difficulty for your spell casting check.
  When successful the spell works and the GM will describe the effects of your successful casting.
  
---

### Character Advancement

  At the logical end of each adventure each player will gain a new skill or increase an existing skill
  one level, gain 1 point to apply to their attributes,  as well as gaining their STR bonus in hit points.

---

### Combat

  Every character has a derived stat called armor class that determines how hard they are to damage.
  This score covers both how hard they are to hit, as well as how hard it is to hurt them when you do hit them.
  A failed attack check may miss entirely, or not hit hard enough to cause harm.
  It's up to the GM to describe it as they see fit.

  A character's armor class is equal to a base of 8, plus their dexterity modifier, plus their armor bonus if any. 

  When attacking you roll your skill check (fighting, throwing, shooting, etc) versus the targets armor class.
  If successful roll damage for your weapon and add your strength bonus if applicable to the attack. 

  Damage is dealt first to hit points and then to STR. "Cannon fodder" enemies usually do not take strength damage,
  and are simply slain when their hit points are exhausted.

---

### Weapons

  Weapons are classified into the following broad damage categories. If your character uses a weapon that doesn't easily
  fit into one of the categories talk to your GM to determine it's stats.

  Melee Weapons:

  Type                      | Example Weapons                                                       | Damage
  --------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------
  Unarmed                   |                                                                       | d2
  Light                     | small or pocket knives, improvised weapons, highly trained unarmed    | d4
  Regular                   | hunting knives, hatchets, small clubs, hammers, or cudgels            | d6
  Medium                    | swords, axes, large one handed clubs or maces, staves or spears       | d8
  Heavy                     | Pole Arms, two handed axes or swords, two handed large clubs or maces | d10

  In general some medium and almost all heavy weapons require 2 hands to wield properly.

---

### Armor & Shields

  Armor and shields add to a characters armor class. Armor has a min and max modifier.
  The minimum represents the bare protection it provides just by being worn (or held in the case of shields).
  The maximum is the max protection it can provide a skilled user.
  Taking talents in armor/shield usage increases the effectiveness up to a cap of the max.

  armor type   |  examples                       | base  | max | penalty
  -------------|----------------------------------|-------|-----|------------
  light        | cloth or padded, thick robes     | +1    | +1  |  0
  medium       | leather                          | +1    | +2  | -2
  heavy        | ring or chain mail               | +2    | +3  | -3
  extra heavy  | plate                            | +2    | +5  | -5
    
  Similar to armor shields provide a bonus to a character's armor class.
    
  type      | base  | max | penalty
  ----------|-------|-----|----------
  small     | +1    | +2  | -3
  medium    | +2    | +3  | -4
  large     | +3    | +4  | -5
    
  Caveats: Wearing light or heavier armor causes a `penalty` to attempts to move
  quietly, cast spells, as well as any difficult non-combat athletic maneuvers 
  such as tumbling, swimming, climbing, etc.
  
  Holding any shield causes similar penalties as armor but at an increased rate of max protection +1.

### Healing and Recovery  

  Hit points are recovered fully after combat ends and characters have a chance to rest for 10-15 minutes.
  All damaged attributes regain points at the rate of 1-d4 a day if the characters are able to eat and rest safely for at
  least 4-6 hours.

  Characters with talents in medicine or first aid can treat physically injured characters to give them a bonus of up to their
  skill level on their daily healing roll.
